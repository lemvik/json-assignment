* Notes on implementation decisions 

** value type as a union-like class

   We would like to do an in-place assignment for values (like obj["foo"] = "var").
   If I was to use inheritance (base json_value, subclasses like json_numeric_value, json_boolean, etc),
   I won't be able to replace the item via assignment operator on the return value
   of [] operator. So union it is.

** copy-initialization issues 

   Currently, `value val = true` will lead to value(double) constructor to be invoked.
